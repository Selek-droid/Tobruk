# Tobruk
A submission for the GamemakerStudio 2 Tropical Game Jam, August 2020!
My game models Operation Compass, the first major British offensive in
North Africa in WW2, in which the British stunned the Italians by taking Tobruk.

The theme is "Three Simple Rules."  My rules:
1. No stacking.
2. Supplied units may move, assault, or defend.
3. Supply sources are a city/town, a road, or an HQ.
